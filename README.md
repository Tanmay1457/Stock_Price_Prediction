🚀 Exciting Update from my Machine Learning Internship at GrowIntern! 🚀

Thrilled to share a glimpse of the stock price prediction project I've been working on during my internship at GrowIntern. 📈

🔍 Project Overview:
I had the incredible opportunity to develop a Stock Market Predictor using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a pre-trained Keras model, the app allows users to input a stock symbol, select start and end dates, and visualize historical stock data along with price predictions.

🛠 Tech Stack Used:

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, yfinance, Keras, scikit-learn, Streamlit, Matplotlib
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Visual Studio Code
📊 Key Features:

Dynamic data retrieval using yfinance.
Visualization of stock data including price vs. moving averages (MA50, MA100, MA200).
Utilization of a pre-trained Keras model for stock price predictions.
Interactive user interface built with Streamlit.
🌐 Impact:
This project has not only honed my skills in machine learning and data visualization but also provided practical insights into the world of financial data analysis. The interactive nature of the app enhances user experience and understanding of stock market trends.

🚀 Learning Experience:
Navigating through real-world financial data and implementing machine learning models has been a challenging yet rewarding journey. Grateful for the guidance and mentorship at GrowIntern, which has accelerated my growth in the field.
